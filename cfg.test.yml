# This YAML exclusion configuration (config) file
# lists all the types of modalities/sequences to 
# be excluded during the DICOM and/or PAR REC to
# nifti (BIDS) conversion.
# 
# The keyword that convertSource is looking for
# is exclude, followed by the different types 
# exclusion names e.g.:
# 
# exclude: SWI,swi,PRESS,press

# The files being exluded here
# are consistent with the 
# neonatal scanning protocol
# for the IRC 287 and 317 studies.

# The corresponding files in the 
# exclude list are those not needed
# for conventional neuroimaging
# analyses:
# 
# - Surveys (or Default)
# - Reg Images (exported by the scanner)
# - Any spectroscopic modalities:
#     - PRESS
# - Secondary Screen Captures
# - Proton Density (PD)

# exclude: SURVEY,survey,Reg,SHORT,LONG,MRS,PRESS,DEFAULT,press,ScreenCapture,PD,ALL,SPECTRO
